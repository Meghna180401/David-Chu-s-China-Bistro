# David Chu's China Bistro

### The site is published at [David Chu's China Bistro](https://meghna180401.github.io/David-Chu-s-China-Bistro/).

## Description
This was the final project I did as a part of a Coursera course - [HTML,CSS and JavaScript For Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome). This is fairly a basic multi-page responsive website of a fictitious restaurant, which can be used as a template for building restaurant portfolio websites. 

It showcases the basic features of a restaurant such as main seating area,google location,menu categories,working hours and reviews. Besides, there's also a Specials category which is randomly updated every time the Specials category page loads - so that you can get a flavour of all ;-) (All thanks to JavaScript!). 

This website also implements responsiveness for comfortable user experience in all kinds of devices.

This project was my first real delve into Web Development.

## Limitations
- The *About* and *Awards* options have not been implemented yet.
- The home page currently has one static image of a restaurant, which I intend to turn into an image slideshow as the Gallery of the restaurant later.
- The overall functionality of this website is basic and can be made more efficient to create a real world product.

## Key Learnings
- Learning HTML5,CSS and JavaScript all from scratch
- Learning about media queries and implementing responsiveness
- Working with tools such as Visual Studio Code
- A glimpse into the World Of Web
- Making code readable and documentation

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Prof. Yaakov Chain (@[Yaakov Chain](https://clearlydecoded.com/)) for his highly extensive and methodical lectures on the basics of Web Development. I never could have imagined implementing a full-fledged web site all from scratch.

I would also like to credit [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for guiding me out every little loophole in my code.

Finally, I would like to thank my best friend [Atrik Ray](https://github.com/AtrikGit6174) for being my biggest supporter at all times.
